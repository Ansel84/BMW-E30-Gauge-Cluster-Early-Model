# BMW E30 Gauge Cluster Early Model
The goal for this project is to reverse engineer every PCB in the gauge cluster for early model year BMW E30's. This includes the main PCB referred to as the "Nexus" board and the smaller boards that are part of the tachometer and speedometer gauge assemblies. The SI (Service Interval) board has already been successfully reverse engineered and improved by Fabian Gmeiner. His project is linked below.
